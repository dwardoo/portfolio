Hey! I'm Edward :)

Ever since I played my first little league basketball game in 1st grade, I had a dream of dunking. I pictured myself soaring through the air and landing the perfect through the legs windmill swish with my teammates cheering me on. Even 10 years later and with a bad knee, I continue to chase my dream. Everyday, you can find me either doing calf raises at my local gym, practicing dunking with a tennis ball, or doing knee recovery stretches. I hope to get my first dunk by June 2022. 


Starting my nonprofit TalentShare was one of the most rewarding experiences of my lifetime. Since its start in 2020, I’ve been able to connect talented people in Irvine with underprivileged youth, inspiring them to pursue their dreams amidst the harsh world created by the pandemic. With help from our 100 volunteers across the district, we have contributed over 300 hours of service to teaching kids in Santa Ana through quality extracurricular workshop events. As we continue to organize monthly events, I hope to grow TalentShare into a global community of people passionate about sharing their talents with other people that need it most.


I grew up with family members and friends that have been hospitalized from diseases such as muscular dystrophy and hemorrhage stroke, and have seen how debilitating it can be both in abilities and spirits to know it will remain a lifetime burden to carry. I think seeing their frustration really inspired me to look for ways to advance healthcare, particularly through machine learning and computer vision. As an intern at the UCI CAIDM Lab under Dr. Peter Chang, I have the unique experience of talking with doctors at the UCI hospital, and working alongside computer programmers to enhance current algorithms in disease diagnosis and treatment. In the future, I see the power and applicability of A.I. continuing to grow in ways we can’t even imagine, and I hope to leverage this tool to advance the new frontiers of bioinformatics in personalized and preventative medicine, saving millions of lives.
