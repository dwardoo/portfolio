Hey! I'm Edward :)

Iâ€™m a developer/problem solver/student and I love <u>sharing my passions with other people</u>. Using technology, I hope to create effective solutions in the field of bioinformatics to fight against poverty, disease, and inequality.

On my free time you can usually find me playing basketball, reading, or hanging out with my friends.
People who know me usually say I have an incessant desire to learn and a let's get it attitude.

Check out my work below :D
