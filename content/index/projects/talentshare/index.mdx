I cofounded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jointalentshare.org/about"><u>TalentShare</u></a> in 2020 and since then, we have grown to a district wide nonprofit that has contributed over 300 hours of service. Every month, we gather people with talents across Irvine Unified School District, and enable them to share their talents with kids in Santa Ana through themed workshop events. Through our various events, we aim to expose kids to quality extracurricular education from experienced volunteers.
