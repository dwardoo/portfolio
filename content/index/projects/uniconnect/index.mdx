Custom built for <a target="_blank" href="https://universityhigh.iusd.org/"><u>University High School</u></a> in Irvine, California, UniConnect is a resource for students and parents to access details on school-wide and student activities, information, sports, events, and more. As one of the original developers, I manage the app content and maintain the admin dashboard. 10,000 downloads, 300 active users per month.
