Research conducted through the <a target="_blank" href="https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/pipact"><u>MIT BWSI PIPACT</u></a> program. Throughout the 8 weeks, I attended weekly lectures, webinars, and meetings regarding COVID-19 Bluetooth contact tracing, constructed my own machine learning model, and wrote a paper for the Final Report Event. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the application of machine learning to map the behavior of RSSI values through walls for contact tracing.
