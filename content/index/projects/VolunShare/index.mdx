While running my nonprofit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jointalentshare.org/"><u>TalentShare</u></a>, I encountered a problem where keeping track of hours became a time consuming tedious task. To solve this problem, I developed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.volunshare.org/"><u>VolunShare</u></a>: an automated volunteer hour tracking app with hour logging, verification, and sharing. 13 organizations, 100 monthly active users, used by Irvine Unified School District.
