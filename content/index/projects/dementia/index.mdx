Despite being one of the most common diseases in the world, Alzheimer’s disease is misdiagnosed at a high rate of 12% to 23%. I developed a novel implementation of the Supervised Contrastive model for improved diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. This is the first paper to describe the potential for SupCon models to be used for classification in the setting of diagnostic medicine.
